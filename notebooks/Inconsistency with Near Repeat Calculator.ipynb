    "# Inconsistency with Near Repeat Calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the most commonly-used implementation of the Knox test - at least within the criminological literature - is the [Near Repeat Calculator (NRC)](http://www.cla.temple.edu/center-for-security-and-crime-science/projects/#near-repeat-calculator), which is a freely-available standalone tool developed by Jerry Ratcliffe. The tool was developed for research purposes, and allows users to apply a version of the Knox test - the same as that which is implemented here - to any set of crime events provided in a specified format. The [manual (PDF)](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/sites/liberalarts/files/NearRepeatsManual.pdf) for the tool provides details of its operation and the nature of the algorithm implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "It appears that the results given by the NRC do not match those provided by the code presented here. This Notebook demonstrates the inconsistency and outlines a possible explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application to test data\n",
    "\n",
    "The inconsistency is demonstrated via application of the algorithms to the test dataset `chicago_burglary_2014_2017.csv`, pre-processed as explained in the [accompanying notebook](Prepare%20example%20data.ipynb). The data is already in the required format for the NRC. For this analysis, we'll work with data from 2016 only.\n",
    "\n",
    "The settings used when applying the NRC - chosen for no particular reason - are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spatial bandwidth**: 100 metres\n",
    "- **Number of spatial bands**: 3\n",
    "- **Temporal bandwidth**: 2 days\n",
    "- **Number of temporal bands**: 2\n",
    "- **Significance level (i.e. number of iterations)**: p=0.05 (i.e. 20)\n",
    "- **Distance setting**: Euclidean\n",
    "\n",
    "The NRC produces two output files (both accompanying this Notebook): a '[summary](nrc_output/chicago_burglary_2016_NRsummary.htm)' document in HTML format, containing headline results, and a '[verbose](nrc_output/chicago_burglary_2016_NRverbose.csv)' file in CSV format, which holds the results of intermediate calculations. The latter includes the *Observed frequencies distribution*, which is essentially the observed contingency table for the underlying data - this contains the number of incident pairs falling within each spatio-temporal band.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the test data, the *Observed frequencies distribution* is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| &nbsp;        |  0 to 2 | 3 to 4 |\n",
    "|---------------|---------|--------|\n",
    "| Same location | 202     | 51     |\n",

    "| 201 to 300    | 456     | 526    |\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then attempt to replicate these results using the implementation presented here."

For example, a temporal band of **'3 to 4'** days in fact includes incidents that are either 2 or 3 days apart, and does not include incidents that are 4 days apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, it appears that what is labelled in the NRC as **'a to b'** in fact represents the interval **\\[a-1, b)**. Since, in the temporal case, the NRC does not use time-of-day information (i.e. it uses the date only), 'strictly less than b' is equivalent to 'less than or equal to (b-1)' in practice.\n",

The results do not correspond to those requested by the user, in the sense that they are out by 1 unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical terms, this issue is much more significant in the temporal dimension than the spatial dimension: the scales involved mean that a difference of one metre (or one foot, *etc*) is of little significance in analysis of this type. Since many studies employ temporal bandwidths between 1 and 7 days, however, the issue represents a much more substantial discrepancy. In particular, since the largest (and most practically consequential) effects are typically found at the shortest scales, the most notable implications are in the initial bands.\n",
    "\n",
    "The apparent issue means that results generated using the NRC which refer to an effect at '0 to 3 days', for example, actually reflect the effect at '0 to 2 days' (strictly this is 'less than 3 days', but since the NRC operates with date information only, these are equivalent). Since it is almost ubiquitous in data that clustering effects decay over time, this means that reported results for these initial temporal bands are likely to over-estimate the true values (with respect to both significance and effect size). Equivalently, when the NRC is used to estimate the extent of a clustering pattern (i.e. identify the period of time over which a significant pattern exists), this is also likely to be over-estimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the temporal decay is particularly pronounced at short timescales, the over-estimation described here is likely to be greatest when short temporal bands are used: the difference in effect between '0 to 2 days' and '0 to 1 day' is greater than that between '0 to 7 days' and '0 to 6 days', for example. In general, therefore, the risk and extent of over-estimation is likely to be highest in applications of the NRC that employ these particularly short bandwidths."
